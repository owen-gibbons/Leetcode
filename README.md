# Leetcodef
This is where I will post my solutions to Leetcode problems. I will try to do 1 problem a day for a while. For now, I cannot guarantee I will post the most efficient solutions, but I will improve solutions later on. As a personal challenge, I will try to use various different programming languages rather than sticking to one.
